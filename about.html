            <div >ROBERT OUYANG RUSLI is an Asian American film composer & artist based in Brooklyn, NY. They have written music for films premiering at TIFF, Sundance, Curaçao IFFR, BAMCinématek, as well as exhibitions featured in the Queens Museum and BAM Next Wave Festival. They are the recipient of the 2017-2018 Van Lier Fellowship for Music Composition, 2021 ASCAP Jimmy Van Heusen Award, 2021 Pioneer Works Music Resident, and a 2022 BAFTA USA Breakthrough.

              <br>
              They recently scored the upcoming film Bruiser which premiered at TIFF, the 2021 Gotham Award-Nominated film Test Pattern, Disney’s The Little Prince(ss), several episodes of Hulu's Your Attention Please, as well as the short film Bambirak which won the Best International Fiction Award at Sundance Film Festival.
              <br>
              <br>
              They produce experimental and political rap music under the name OHYUNG. Their first album Untitled (Chinese Man with Flame) was released by Deathbomb Arc. In 2020, OHYUNG released their sophomore album PROTECTOR (Chinabot), an experimental rap cross-genre collision course through distorted 808s, pitch-shifted rapping, frenetic pop energy, and atmospheric loops. They recently released their noise record GODLESS in collaboration with percussionist Matt Evans, and most recently their two hour ambient record imagine naked!, described by Popmatters as “one of the most thoughtful, cathartic ambient records of the recent era, powering through emotional walls to produce an album as daring in sheer ambition as it is rendering in its effect."
              <br>
              <br>
              They have performed for SXSW, Boiler Room, and many clubs and spaces in NYC such as Le Poisson Rouge, Roulette, Elsewhere, Nowadays, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY Live Arts x BAM Pride, Trans Pecos, and WNYC's The Greene Room.
