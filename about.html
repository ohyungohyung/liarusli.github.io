            Under her solo moniker OHYUNG, she produces genre-shifting music that moves between ambient, experimental pop, and distorted noise. Her most recent record imagine naked! is a collection of ambient soundscapes out now on NNA tapes and was described by The Quietus as a “masterful selection of muscular, shuddering, trembling ambient excursions” and was hailed by NPR as one of the best 50 albums of 2022.

            in NYC such as Roulette, Elsewhere, Nowadays, the
