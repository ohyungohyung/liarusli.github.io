            They produce experimental and political rap music under the name
            OHYUNG. Their first album Untitled (Chinese Man with Flame) was
            released by Deathbomb Arc. In 2020, OHYUNG released their sophomore
            album PROTECTOR (Chinabot), an experimental rap cross-genre
            collision course through distorted 808s, pitch-shifted rapping,
            frenetic pop energy, and atmospheric loops. They recently released
            their noise record GODLESS in collaboration with percussionist Matt
            Evans, and most recently their two hour ambient record imagine
            naked!, described by Popmatters as “one of the most thoughtful,
            cathartic ambient records of the recent era, powering through
            emotional walls to produce an album as daring in sheer ambition as
            it is rendering in its effect."
