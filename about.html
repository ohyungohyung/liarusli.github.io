            She makes solo music, DJs, and performs under the moniker OHYUNG. Drawing on ambient soundscapes, harsh noise and euphoric pop, OHYUNG brings together disparate sounds and influences in her music. Her most recent album You Are Always On My Mind was released on March 28th, and was described by Pitchfork as "Strains of the New York noise, rap, and ambient scenes alchemized into an extraordinary burst of pop." Her previous record imagine naked! is a collection of ambient soundscapes out now on NNA tapes and was described by The Quietus as a “masterful selection of muscular, shuddering, trembling ambient excursions” and was hailed by NPR as one of the best 50 albums of 2022.

          <p class="margin-bottom-md">
